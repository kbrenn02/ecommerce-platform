### Starting a Project
Create folder for frontend in VSCode, then in the terminal, type npx create-react-app frontend
Cd into the frontend folder, then run npm react-router-dom
npm start to run the project

### Clearing out the Project
so you can start from square 1.
In src > App.js, remove the header
In public > index.html, change the title

### Setting up
In the src folder, create the following 3 folders:
- Pages (create ecommerce pages)
- Components
- Context (used for context APIs)

The App.js file is the start. So in that div, I need to add the <Navbar /> element I created
